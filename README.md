## ✍️ Reflection

### What challenges did you face and how did you solve them?
One of the biggest challenges was organizing and structuring my portfolio content in a way that was both visually appealing and easy to navigate. I found that breaking content into clear sections helped create a more intuitive experience. Another challenge was managing GitHub Pages deployment. At first, the site wasn’t loading correctly, but I solved this by carefully checking my file paths, repository settings, and ensuring that my `index.html` file was in the root directory. Understanding how GitHub Pages works was a valuable learning experience.

### How would you improve the portfolio next?
In the future, I’d like to improve the mobile responsiveness and add animations to enhance user interaction. I also plan to expand the case study section with more detailed project breakdowns and include interactive prototypes. Lastly, incorporating accessibility best practices will be a key focus to ensure the portfolio is inclusive to all users.
